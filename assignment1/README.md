# First assignment

1. Detailed derivation of MoG algorithm (via direct maximization of likelihood)
2. Detailed derivation of EM-MoG
3. Implement EM-MoG and run your algorithm on toy dataset (for instance, you generate 2-dimensional
examples from three Gaussians (with different means and covariance matrices) and determine three clusters
using EM-MoG)
